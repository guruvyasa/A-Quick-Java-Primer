# Threads


A thread sometimes known as an execution context or a lightweight processâ€“is a single sequential flow of control within a process. As a sequential flow of control, a thread must carve out some of its own resources within a running program (it must have its own execution stack and program counter for example). The code running within the thread only works within that context. Thus, other texts use execution context as a synonym for thread.
