# Nested Classes

The Java programming language allows you to define a class within another class. Such a class is called a nested class and is illustrated here:
```
class OuterClass {
    ...
    class NestedClass {
        ...
    }
}
```
**Terminology:** Nested classes are divided into two categories: static and non-static. Nested classes that are declared static are called static nested classes. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes.
