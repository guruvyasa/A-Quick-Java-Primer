# Class members (static)
In our Employee class, we had a variable which was "static",numberOfEmployees. Because it was static we were able to refer to it without creating an instance of Employee in the Company class. **The use of the static keyword creates fields and methods that belong to the class, rather than to an instance of the class. **
