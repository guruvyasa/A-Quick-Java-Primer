# Class members (static)

## Class Variables
In our Employee class, we had a variable which was "static",numberOfEmployees. Because it was static we were able to refer to it without creating an instance of Employee in the Company class. **The use of the static keyword creates fields and methods that belong to the class, rather than to an instance of the class. **. 

## Class Methods 
In our Employee class we had a method called "getNumberOfEmployees". This method was static, thus it is a class method not instance method. To call this method we do not need an instance of Employee.

Not all combinations of instance and class variables and methods are allowed:

* Instance methods can access instance variables and instance methods directly.
* Instance methods can access class variables and class methods directly.
* Class methods can access class variables and class methods directly.
* Class methods cannot access instance variables or instance methods directlyâ€”they must use an object reference. Also, class methods cannot use the this keyword as there is no instance for this to refer to.
