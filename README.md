# Introduction

**Java**: A simple, portable, object oriented  and secure language
Java programs are written in a file with the extension .java. Steps involved in running a Java program are:

**The compiler**: javac is the compiler which converts java code into a code which the jvm (java virtual machine) can understand. This new code(called bytecode) is stored in a .class file. 
The .class file is read by the jre ie. java runtime (java command) and output is produced.

**Java Platform**: Hardware or software environment in which java program runs.
Java platform has two components:

**Java Application Programming Interface:** Large collection of ready-made software components, grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces. These libraries are called “packages”. A simple illustration of the process followed:

The general-purpose, high-level Java programming language is a powerful software platform. Every full implementation of the Java platform gives you the following features:

* **Development Tools:** The development tools provide everything you'll need for compiling, running, monitoring, debugging, and documenting your applications. As a new developer, the main tools you'll be using are the javac compiler, the java launcher, and the javadoc documentation tool.

* **Application Programming Interface (API):** The API provides the core functionality of the Java programming language. It offers a wide array of useful classes ready for use in your own applications. It spans everything from basic objects, to networking and security, to XML generation and database access, and more. The core API is very large; to get an overview of what it contains, consult the Java Platform Standard Edition 8 Documentation.

* ** Deployment Technologies:** The JDK software provides standard mechanisms such as the Java Web Start software and Java Plug-In software for deploying your applications to end users.

* **User Interface Toolkits:** The JavaFX, Swing, and Java 2D toolkits make it possible to create sophisticated Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

* **Integration Libraries**: Integration libraries such as the Java IDL API, JDBC API, Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, Java RMI, and Java Remote Method Invocation over Internet Inter-ORB Protocol Technology (Java RMI-IIOP Technology) enable database access and manipulation of remote objects.
